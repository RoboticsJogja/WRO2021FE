We did not use any 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements.

We build the vehicle mostly from Legos and attach the non-Lego elements with glue or bolts and nuts.

Here we uploaded the 3D model of the Lego parts of the vehicle.

You can find the final building of the vehicle in the photos folder.
